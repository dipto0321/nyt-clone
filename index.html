                    <p>
                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new
                        son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing
                        far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
                        been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                        begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused
                        space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                        swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                        detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                        around it.</p>
                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                        right.</p>
                    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
                        telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
                        Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
                        so-called <a href="#" class="bold-link">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
                        being wrenched violently apart when
                        it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                        long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
                        Dr. Guth was correct.

                    </p>
                    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                        wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                        discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                        vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                        space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
                        cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
                        there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot
                        of pasta water boiling over.

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
                    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
                        beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                        Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
                        according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                    <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                        team, said, <q>"This is huge, as big as it gets."</q></p>
                    <p>He continued, <q>“This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded
                            in gravitational waves.”</q></p>
                    <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                        permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as
                        hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging
                        of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
                        Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical
                        Journal.
