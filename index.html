                    <p>
                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new
                        son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing
                        far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>





                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
                        been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                        begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused
                        space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                        swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                        detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                        around it.</p>
                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                        right.</p>
